# ðŸŽ¬ Assignment: Bringing Web Pages to Life with CSS & JavaScript

In this assignment, youâ€™ll create a visually dynamic and interactive experience by combining the beauty of **CSS3 animations** with the logic and power of **JavaScript functions**. By the end, youâ€™ll have a mini interactive experience that not only looks goodâ€”but *feels* responsive and alive!

---

## ðŸŽ¨âœ¨ Part 1: CSS3 Transitions and Animations for Dynamic Styling Effects

Start by enhancing elements on your page using **CSS transitions** and **keyframe animations**. You can animate things like:

* Button hover effects
* Smooth fades, slides, or transforms
* Continuous or triggered animations using `@keyframes`

**Goal:** Create a page that visually responds to user interaction and/or time-based triggers using only CSS.

## ðŸ“šâœ¨ Part 2: JavaScript Functions â€” Scope, Parameters & Return Values

Now itâ€™s time to dive deeper into how **functions** actually work. In this section:

* Write several custom functions that take in **parameters** and return **useful values**
* Demonstrate understanding of **local vs global scope**
* Show how functions can be reused to control animation, trigger DOM changes, or calculate values

**Goal:** Show functional thinking by building small, reusable pieces of logic that clearly use parameters, return values, and demonstrate scope awareness.

## ðŸŽ¨ðŸŽ¬ Part 3: Combining CSS Animations with JavaScript

Hereâ€™s the real magicâ€”combine the two worlds!

Use JavaScript to **trigger** CSS animations dynamically. Think along the lines of:

* A button that animates a box when clicked
* A card flip animation on hover or click
* A loading animation that starts/stops based on user input
* A popup/modal that slides in and fades out based on events

**Goal:** Use JavaScript to **add/remove classes** or modify styles dynamically to trigger CSS animations. Bonus if you make it reusable with functions!

---

## Deliverables

Submit a project folder that includes:

* `index.html` â€” Your structured content
* `styles.css` â€” All your transitions and keyframe animations
* `script.js` â€” Your functional logic demonstrating scope, parameters, return values, and animation triggers

Each part of the assignment should be clearly labeled and commented to show your understanding.

---

## Outcome

Youâ€™ll be evaluated on:

* Use of CSS transitions and animations to enhance UI
* Quality and clarity of JavaScript functions (with parameters and return values)
* Effective integration of CSS and JS for interactive effects
* Code readability, modularity, and documentation
* Creativity and user experience
